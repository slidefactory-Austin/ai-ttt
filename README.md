# Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Play

To play the game, simply click on an empty square to place your X or O. The first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all squares are filled and no one has won, the game ends in a tie.

You can play against the computer, which uses a minimax algorithm to determine its moves.

To start a new game, click the "New Game" button.
